In this project, i check sudoku by create three child and each child responsable of check rowcloumnmatrix 33.

The main process create three child and for each child create pipe,in addition one pipe for all. 
Three pipe to read the sudoku and other to return if sudoku is legal. 
When the father do fork the child start perform two thing  move the FD of read to STDIN and write to STDOUT,
the second close the FD will not be used. And after that the child execute the program by execv. 
Also father close the FD will not be used and wait the child write to pipe and read the answer.
